# dotfiles

This is just a fork I made to help a friend get set started using [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot). These are not my dotfiles.

# Set-up
#### 1. Clone the repo to your preferred location and enter the root directory
  `git clone https://github.com/OxSon/.dotfiles`
  
  `cd .dotfiles`

#### 2. Init & update submodules
  `git submodule init && git submodule update`

#### 3. Install 
  `./install`
  * Note: at this point you may want to edit the config file at `.dotfiles/default.conf.yaml`. Please refer to the excellent project documentation available at [the dotbot project page](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot).
